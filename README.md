# PpDTW

A demonstration of algorithms for securely DTW distance computation between two mutually unstrusted but benign(semi-honest) parties without disclose input from either party.



## Components

- app: a simple app to call the main method in its `onCreate` so that to run the algorithms on smartphone.
- sclib: a series of crypto primitives and algorithms to implement the secure computation protocols.



## Dependencies

- Bouncy Castle https://www.bouncycastle.org/
